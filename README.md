# 🩺 Heart Disease Detection Using Fuzzy Clustering ❤️

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Detection Using Fuzzy Clustering** project! 🚀 This innovative project leverages **fuzzy clustering** techniques to analyze medical data and detect heart disease patterns. Built with Python and machine learning libraries, it aims to provide insightful analysis for healthcare professionals and researchers. 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

Heart disease remains a leading health challenge worldwide, and early detection is key to saving lives. This project uses **fuzzy clustering** (e.g., Fuzzy C-Means) to group patients based on medical attributes, identifying patterns that indicate heart disease risk. Unlike traditional clustering, fuzzy clustering allows for soft assignments, making it ideal for complex medical datasets where boundaries are not always clear. 🩺

This project builds on the author's previous work, such as the Heart Disease Analysis, but focuses on advanced clustering techniques for enhanced detection.

## 🎯 Planned Features

| **Feature** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** | Clean and normalize medical data for clustering. |
| 📊 **Fuzzy Clustering** | Apply Fuzzy C-Means or similar algorithms to group patients by risk profiles. |
| 🤖 **Pattern Detection** | Identify clusters associated with heart disease indicators. |
| 📈 **Visualization** | Create plots (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps) to visualize clusters and features. |
| 🌐 **Web Interface** | (Optional) Build a Streamlit app for interactive analysis. |
| 💾 **Model Export** | Save clustering models for reuse or further analysis. |

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset will include medical attributes similar to those in the Heart Disease Analysis project, such as:

| **Column** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `age` | Age of the patient 👶👴 |
| `sex` | Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female) 🚹🚺 |
| `cp` | Chest pain type (0 = typical angina; 1 = atypical angina; 2 = non-anginal pain; 3 = asymptomatic) 🤕 |
| `trestbps` | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) 🩺 |
| `chol` | Serum cholesterol in mg/dL 🩺 |
| `fbs` | Fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dL (1 = true; 0 = false) 🍬 |
| `restecg` | Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = probable/definite left ventricular hypertrophy) 📈 |
| `thalach` | Maximum heart rate achieved 💓 |
| `exang` | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 🏃‍♂️ |
| `oldpeak` | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 📉 |
| `slope` | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping; 1 = flat; 2 = downsloping) 📏 |
| `ca` | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy 🩻 |
| `thal` | Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect) 🧬 |
| `target` | Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no) ❤️🚫 |
